As the name suggests, the project is based on RFID- radio frequency identification. RFID based smart lock consists of RFID Reader, RFID Tag, LCD display, 4X4 keypad, plunger (solenoid lock) and microcontroller unit. RFID can be interfaced to microcontroller through USART. Data is transferred from RFID cards to reader and from there to microcontroller. The main aim of the project was to drive the lock by RFID. The door will unlock only when RFID tag matches the roll number of authorized student.
RFID based Smart lock can be used in many companies and institutions. It permits only specific people having authorization to allow through the door. This can minimize the chaos and also give security from unauthorized people. It also manages attendance for a particular place. It can also change the authorization of people according to time. For example, in an institute, on Monday morning a particular batch will attend the lab and it will be unauthorized for everyone else.
